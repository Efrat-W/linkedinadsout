is a Chrome extension aiming to hide irrelevant content from the PC LinkedIn website. Many posts are promoted content which most users don't find interest at, nut hand-in-hand, this extension leaves the page structure as it is without harming the original source code of the website.
## Installation

Use the Chrome Extension Store [Here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkedin-adsout/aligdecagehcnbdngnhckjcakjfpoomo) to install the extension.    
After installation it'll appear at the extension section in the browser.

## Usage
 There are two modes of usage, using the switch in the extension window the page will reload with the activated mode:
> ### Linked : IN - Ads : OUT
When the extension is **activated**, it removes the side element from the feed page and the footer that is also present there, causing the page to have more space for the text in the posts.  
In addition, the extension scans for promoted posts on the page and hides them using the CSS setting of  ```display: none``` which doesn't remove the post from the page source code.
> ### Linked : OUT - Ads : IN
When the extension is **deactivated** everything goes back to normal.
## Contributing and Future Plans

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.  

I am interested to add a personal adjustment function to the extension, that will act as contrast to the algorithm suggesting or under-suggesting posts that might interest me.
